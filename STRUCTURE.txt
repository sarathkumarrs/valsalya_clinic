Project structure (clean separation)

formatted_site/
  index.html          # HTML only (no inline CSS/JS)
  index.css           # CSS moved from the old <style> block in index.html
  main.js             # JS moved from old <script> blocks + inline handlers
  style.css           # Your existing stylesheet (hospital card + footer styles)
  specialities.html
  specialities.css

Notes:
- index.html links style.css first, then index.css (to preserve the original CSS override order).
- main.js is loaded at the end of <body>, same as before.
